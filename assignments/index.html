				<p class="box-content">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
				And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
				And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
				And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
				And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</p>

				<h2 class="box-heading box-heading-2">TO THE FOURTH DAY</h2>
				<p class="box-content">And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
				And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas:and it was so.And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</p>

                And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
               And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>
